PROBLEM 2: Aggregation

2B: total amount of all loans per month
COMMENTS: Since I am being asked for the total amount of the loans, I use the SUM() aggregate function to add up the quantities in the 'amount' column of the loans table that fulfill a certain condition/grouping. The grouping in question is the month. Thus, I used EXTRACT() to then extract the month from the timestamps in the created column and ordered them in ascending order for presentability.

SELECT SUM(amount), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) FROM loans GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ASC;
