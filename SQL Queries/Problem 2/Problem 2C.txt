Problem 2: Aggregation 

2C: average amount of each loan per month
COMMENTS: Since I am being asked for the average amount of each loan, I used the AVG() function to take the average of the quantities of the 'amount' column of the loans table that fulfill a certain grouping. The grouping and ordering is the same in this query as it was the last because the problem asked for an aggregate per month.

SELECT AVG(amount), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) FROM loans GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ASC;
