Problem 2: Aggregation

2E: largest loan size per month
COMMENTS: Since I am being asked for the largest loan size, I used the MAX() function to find the largest quantities in the amount column of the loans table that fulfill a certain grouping. The grouping and ordering is the same in this query as it was the last because the problem asked for an aggregate per month.

SELECT MAX(amount), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) FROM loans GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ASC;
