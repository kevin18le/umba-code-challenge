Problem 2: Aggregation

2D: smallest loan size per month
COMMENTS: Since I am being asked for the smallest loan size, I used the MIN() function to find the smallest quantities in the amount column of the loans table that fulfill a certain grouping. The grouping and ordering is the same in this query as it was the last because the problem asked for an aggregate per month.

SELECT MIN(amount), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) FROM loans GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created) ASC;
